# = What Ruport Is
#
# Ruby Reports (Ruport) is an extensible reporting system.
# 
# It aims to be as lightweight as possible while still providing core support
# for data aggregation and manipulation as well as multi-format rendering 
# of reports.
#
# Ruport provides tools for using a number of data sources, including CSV files,
# ActiveRecord models, and raw SQL connections via RubyDBI.
#
# Data manipulation is easy as there are standard structures that support
# record, table, and grouping operations.  These all can be extended to
# implement custom behavior as needed.
#
# For common tasks, Ruport provides formatters for CSV, HTML, PDF, and text-
# based reports.  However, the real power lies in building custom renderers and
# formatters.  The base formatting libraries provide a number of helper
# functions that will let you build complex reports while maintaining a DRY and
# consistent interface.
#
# Since Ruport's core support is intentionally minimalistic, you may be looking
# for some higher level support for specific needs such as graphing, invoices,
# report mailing support, etc.  For this, you may wish to take a look at the
# ruport-util package, which contains some generally useful tools and libraries
# to extend Ruport's capabilities.
#
# = Installation 
#
# To install ruport via rubygems with all it's dependencies (except DBI):
#   
#   sudo gem install ruport -y
#
# Check to see if it installed properly:
#
#   ruby -rubygems -e "require 'ruport'; puts Ruport::VERSION"
#
# If you get an error, please consult the mailing list. 
#
# Dependencies Details:
#   
#  -- formatting
#
# Ruport relies on PDF::Writer and FasterCSV for its formatting support.
# If you want to make use of textile helpers, you'll also need RedCloth
#
#  -- database interaction
#
# If you wish to use Ruport to report against a rails project, 
# a camping project, or do standalone AAR reports, you'll need ActiveRecord.
#
# If you want to use Ruport::Query for raw SQL support, you'll need to 
# install RubyDBI and whatever database drivers you might need.
