# = What Ruport Is. 
#
# Ruby Reports is a software library that aims to make the task of reporting
# less tedious and painful.  It provides tools for data acquisition, database
# interaction, formatting, and parsing/munging.  Designed to be extensible,
# it is possible to use Ruport for quick specific tasks as well as to build
# robust reporting applications.
#
# = Installation 
#
# Dependencies:
#   
#   Ruport has a number of dependencies.
#     
#   Ruby/DBI and appropriate dbds: Makes Query useable 
#   (must be installed manually)
#
#   FasterCSV: Enables fast CSV parsing
#   (available via rubygems)
#     
#   RedCloth:  Enables textile/markdown filtering
#   (available via rubygems)
#    
#   PDF::Writer: Enables printable documents 
#   (available via rubygems)
#
#   MailFactory: For email support. 
#   (available via rubygems)
#
#   Scruffy: For Graph Support
#   (available via rubygems)
#
# Note that by installing any of the dependencies, either via gems or manually,
# their functionality will automatically be enabled.
#
# To install ruport via rubygems with all it's dependencies (except DBI):
#   
#   sudo gem install ruport -y
#
# To install ruport manually via setup.rb:
# 
#   sudo ruby setup.rb
#
# To not install ruport at all:
#
#   ruby -Ipath/to/ruport/lib my_script.rb
#
# Check to see if it installed properly:
#
#   ruby -rubygems -e "require 'ruport'; puts Ruport::VERSION"
#   (omit the -rubygems flag if installed manually)
#
# If you get an error, please consult the mailing list. 
#
# = Getting Started
#
# Building a report can be broadly broken up into two phases. 
#
# == Data Collection and Manipulation
# 
# To begin, your data must be read from its source and stored in Ruport's 
# standard data structures. Ruport::Data::Table, Ruport::Data::Record, and
# Ruport::Data::Grouping have further information on how to work with
# and store data in ruport.
#
# If you wish to retrieve your data using Ruby on Rails and ActiveRecord,
# please see the acts_as_reportable plugin.
# 
# == Report Generation
#
# Once the data is ready, it can be rendered using a combination of
# Ruport::Renderer and Ruport::Formatter. 
# The renderer defines the report type (tabular, graph, etc), and 
# the formatter renders the engine into a final format (PDF, CSV, HTML, SVG). 
# Renderers will often interact with more than one formatter, to allow the same
# report to be rendered in multiple ways ie. as HTML and a PDF.
# 
# To tie these together, a basic DSL is provided by Ruport::Report
#
# For further reading and specific examples, please explore the examples/ 
# directory in the source tree.

# = Resources
#
# The best way to get help and make suggestions is the Ruport mailing list.
# This software is on the move, so the list is the most reliable way of getting
# up to date information.
#
# - You can sign up and/or view the archives here:
#     http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-reports
#
# Please do not hesitate to use this list!  I am happily accepting patches and
# documentation, as well as encouraging design discussions and also am quite
# curious about what people use or want to use ruport for.
#
# I will announce Ruport releases on RubyTalk, on the Ruport mailing list, on
# Freshmeat, and RAA.  If you would like to
# keep an eye out for releases, please monitor one of those places.
#
#   - You may download Ruport's source from the project page:
#     http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruport
#
#   - The latest stable API documentation is available at:
#     http://api.rubyreports.org
#
# There are also some tutorial available:
# http://stonecode.svnrepository.com/ruport/trac.cgi/wiki/TutorialsAndArticles
#
# If you are interested in developing Ruport, please *never* study code in
# official releases.  As this software is in it's early stages, it's essential
# to keep an eye on the subversion repository.  If you let me know you are
# interested in working on something, I will let you know if I'm actively
# working on that section.
#
# - Grabbing the code from the svn trunk is simple:
#
#   svn co svn://rubyforge.org//var/svn/ruport/trunk/ ruport
#
# - Or if you are interested in the latest updates to the stable branch
#
#   svn co svn://rubyforge.org//var/svn/ruport/branches/stable ruport
#
# Thanks for checking out Ruport!
#
# If you have any questions or concerns, hop on the mailing list and fire away!
