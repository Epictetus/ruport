h1. Introduction

Thank you for taking the time to learn about Ruby Reports.  

In a nutshell, Ruport is a free software library that is designed
specifically to make the task of reporting less painful.  I've been developing a
number of toolsets to make my life easier, and I hope that they can do this for
you as well.

Some of the functionality Ruport currently provides include:

* Data acquisition modules that allow loading data from sources
  including CSV, SQL, and ActiveRecord
  
* Data normalization into a standardized and well integrated datastructure.

* Data formatting including tabular formatting, text filters, and structured documents

* Data delivery as part of an HTML page, via email, or out to a file.

Ruby Reports provides an extendable formatting system, so you can add in 
arbitrary formatting support as needed.  The tools provided can be used in a 
stand-alone command-line application, integrated into a Rails application,
or in any other Ruby program.

Some of the key strengths of Ruport:

* Data sources are extracted, therefore reports can be generated from
eclectic data sources ranging from text files generated by legacy VMS
applications to data extracted via ActiveRecord. 

* Data normalization happens in a central part of your code so that no
matter the input source or the output format, the data can be accessed through
a consistent interface.

* Output can be formatted in many different ways allowing for generation of 
PDF, HTML, and text based reports from the same data.

The recipes that follow will help you use Ruport to meet your reporting needs.
They are meant to cover the common problem areas of building a reporting
application and to show how to solve these problems reasonably.  Most of these
recipes have been extracted from real world applications, so that means they'll
be focused on actual needs.

I hope that you find the information you need here to happily complete whatever
task you need to do.  If you find yourself stuck, please see the Resources
section at the end of this book for links to a number of great places to go for
help.
