Sometimes you just gotta pay some mad propz to the peoples.

- Daniel Berger for releasing gruf to the community

- James Edward Gray II for letting me take query.rb and mash it into something
  that eventually became Ruport 0.1.0

- Austin Ziegler for suggesting the Ruby License, which hopefully keeps everyone
  happy.

- All the people at RubyConf 2005, new_haven.rb, and NYC.rb that made
  suggestions and let me know what kind of problems they were dealing with.

- The people on the Ruport mailing list who will happily run unit tests and
  check out little things for me when I need it.

- Francis Hwang for overall design suggestions and the contribution of SqlSplit.
  Additionally, his efforts on DBI to bring it back to life.  (Along with the
  rest of the new DBI team)

- Mathijs Mohlmann for pointing out that the DataRow constructor sucks and
  offering some patches for changes to Ruport. 

- Gregory Gibson for pretending like I'm a worthwhile business investment, and
  providing funding to let me work on Ruport, instead of like... working in a
  coffee shop or something.

- 'A Monkey' for catching a bug before I even commited it to SVN.

- Simon Claret for neato PDF table support

- Dudley Flanders for DataSet psuedo keyword support

- RubyTalk, #ruby-lang and the Ruby community in general. 
  Each and every one of you is my homie.

- James Healy for the original code for Report::Invoice
