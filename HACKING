Hacking on Ruby Reports : A Guide For Contributors
--------------------------------------------------

If you'd like to help test, maintain, or develop on Ruport, 
this document is for you.

We try to be as community friendly as possible, and we welcome all sorts of
contributions to our project.  Here are a few different ways you can help.

  - Adding Tests and Hunting for bugs. 

  - Improving documentation or writing tutorials

  - Helping with our primary development tasks

  - Helping with some secondary tasks

  - Improving our visual identity / web resources

  - Testing new releases and sharing your experiences.


If any of these things sound appealing to you, there are a few things
you should do:

1) Sign up on the mailing list: http://list.rubyreports.org/

2) Post and introduce yourself, letting us know what you'd like to work on OR
   Find dudleyf,sandal,or jh in #ruport on Freenode and let us know there.

3) If you plan on implementing new features, please take a look at our
   project roadmap:

   http://stonecode.svnrepository.com/ruport/trac.cgi/wiki/ProjectRoadmap

4) Also, please read the SubmittingChangeRequests, ReportingDefects, and
   SubmittingPatches Trac wiki pages, where appropriate.

5) Please pull the latest code from SVN.  If you are hunting bugs in released
   code, please grab the latest code from branches/stable, otherwise use trunk.

This should hopefully be enough to get you on the right track.  We welcome your
questions and ideas, so don't be afraid to contact us.

Happy Hacking!
