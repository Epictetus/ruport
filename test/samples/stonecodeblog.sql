Some people, myself included, use the Internet for work. I am fortunate enough to be able to work remotely from school using the universityâ€™s Internet connection.

I realize that my initial email was harsh but it served it\'s purpose in generating awareness among students.  I hardly consider this an abuse of the system, however, I do try to keep my usage of it to a minimum, moving public discussion here for instance.\r\n\r\nThe fact that there was more to the story than the tech department let us know I considered important information which should be distributed to the student body.    You may disagree, however I know that a sizeable portion of the community was appreciative of my efforts, due to the 5 emails, 7 instant messages, and two positive comments on the board.\r\n\r\nIf 14 people were positively effected by my message, I see it is a perfectly reasonable use of a system that is designed for such a use.

My own personal view is that too many people find it an easier undertaking to sit idly by while the rest of the world makes decisions that directly effect each of us and then quietly complain/or not about the end result. \r\nI think there is a much larger issue here than is being addressed. First, it is everyone\'s right, especially in this collegiate setting, to have an opinion and rights and to be able to freely voice/defend both. If there were more people like Greg who were passionate about something perhaps the changes that everyone sought would happen in a more timely fashion. From my own personal viewpoint, students have become so reliant upon others making decisions for them that they blindly accept anything that is spoon-fed to them and don\'t question anything. I\'ve seen more people agree with nonsense or take it as \"fact\" when in actuality what they were being told was simply not logical or even remotely feasible. \r\nNow on to my next point. Again, as a student coming from a state university outages were quite commonplace and the only way a student could find out what the problem was we had to contact the university ourselves. Ever try to get an actual human on the phone in a state university? It\'s like trying to ambidextrous violin player in a crack house. In light of that fact, I did think that while the email from the Techno-geek staff was mildly confusing I did however, appreciate that they sent out even the smallest tidbit of an explanation. I thought that in itself was the responsible thing to do.\r\nIn closing I will add that to personally attack people in a sophomoric fashion for having an opinion is not only embarrassing to the author, but is not representative of the intellectual integrity of the student population at UNH.

The University never has enough money to do this, or that, or the other. This is always the excuse I hear. So why is this the case? Is it not a known fact that the University earns upwards of around 30,000 per student per year?!  At the school I attended before this one I was paying around 2,000 per year, and I never had any complaints as far as facilities, networks, parking, etc. etc. etc. go. At the school I attended before this one, the computer lab was in a huge beautiful building with state of the art computers, rather than in a trailer with half-par computers. Also, every classroom was a \"smart classroom\" and this was back in 2002 and 2003, and that was not to mention that the entire campus had wi-fi access. \r\n\r\nDonâ€™t get me wrong I have noticed the improvements that have been made, and I have been happy with them, but nevertheless, if I\'m paying 15 times the amount I was paying at my former school, shouldn\'t I be getting 15 times the education, 15 times the facilities, 15 times the parking, and 15 times the network reliability?!\r\n\r\nAgain, don\'t get me wrong, I do like this University a lot.

It seems as if the priorities of the University are placed slightly more on the first impression of students rather than the lasting impression of the current students.  It\'s understandable that this is important to some extent, but it doesn\'t mean they should neglect critical services to do so.  From the rumor mill, I\'ve heard that the technology department\'s funding has not been lowered in exchange for campus beautification, but the fact that it hasn\'t increased along with the increased need is troubling to me.  The bottom line is, if the school wants to experience growth, they can\'t just slap up a few extra residence halls and leave out the tremendous additional support structure necessary.  It\'s a vicious cycle, but hopefully things like this will help bring light to the issue.\r\n\r\nMy question to you about your former school is whether it was a public school.  If it was, my answer to your expectations is a simple \"no\" because the schools are funded substantially by the government while private institutions for lack of a better term need to pimp themselves to rich alumni to get most of their funds.   However, if it was a private school, we should be on the phone with them figuring out how the hell they fund themselves so well!\r\n\r\nMy feeling at UNH is that it\'s important to get students to come here, but even more important to keep them, and to do that, we need to take care of what really matters first, before we put a nice icing on the cake.',0,'1','Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6','',0,2),(28,12,'Kevin Laroche','Klaro1@newhaven.edu','','192.132.64.2','2005-09-21 16:42:17','2005-09-21 20:42:17','Hey greg, I can assure that Greg Bartholemew is doing everything in his power to keep the network running smooth.

The finger I point is only at whoever mismanaged scheduling which caused the excessive delay.  Greg recognized the points that I had to make about student relations, and I can tell by his emails to the campus that he put some effort into being more sensitive to student needs than he did before this chaos ensued.  If you read through the entire post above, I never accused Greg or Alan of not working hard.  As far as I\'m concerned, I am happy that the new part is in place and that the opinions of the student body have been voiced, and that it certainly seems that the technology department has listened.  Now, if only the university would address issues on funding, this situation would be ideal.\r\n\r\nBy calling me ridiculous and clearly not fully reading my article, you certainly do not reflect your department well.  However, I must reiterate that both Alan and Greg were as professional as I could expect two individuals in high positions under pressure could be.\r\n\r\nAnd for those who assume that this rant was without dialogue between myself and the IT department (which is what you suggest), that is simply not true.\r\n\r\nI talked to both Alan and Greg and got answers to all of my questions before I stated my opinion on this weblog.\r\n\r\nThat having been said, the commotion this has caused is certainly overwhelming.  I\'d be happy simply to let it rest at this point with the lessons learned by myself, the student body, the technology department, and the university preserved.',0,'1','Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050521 Firefox/1.0.4','',0,2),(30,12,'Kevin Laroche','Klaro1@newhaven.edu','','192.132.64.2','2005-09-21 17:11:59','2005-09-21 21:11:59','Just to clarify I\'m a work study student and My reply to your blog doesn\'t represent the It dept in anyway.',0,'1','Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/412.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/412.5','',0,0),(31,12,'Greg','gregory.t.brown@gmail.com','http://stonecode.org','192.132.64.2','2005-09-21 17:16:49','2005-09-21 21:16:49','I made that assumption by your comments, but I\'m thankful that you cleared that  up.

I am a resident who stays on campus. I was a little sad that it went down and a little frustrated. However i got a lot of homework done.\r\n\r\nA few points of note. We aren\'t a large state university like UConn or PennState, therefore, we do not get state funding for technology like UConn or PennState does. Tuition at private universities like this one and University of Hartford is always higher than State Universities. We pay a lot of money, and banks pay the rest. However i do not thnk that because a lot of money is paid on our behalf(i personally only know of one person who doesn\'t get any financial aid) I don\'t think that gives us a \"right\" to internet access. I see it more as a privilage, such as driving a car.\r\n\r\nI also see the internet becoming more and more like the \"Easy\" button you see on the Staples commercials. It\'s very easy to host online meetings instead of local meetings. More people can attend who wouldnt be able to otherwise. You can talk to all your friends at once and get help with homework you are having trouble with without having to run all over campus. But i think too many of us rely too much on the internet and when our \"Easy\" button breaks we panic and aren\'t sure what to do.\r\n\r\nAlso, i was told that working for anyone outside the university from my dorm using the internet was prohibited as well as setting up a business from within my dorm and using the internet connection to promote it was also prohibited.\r\n\r\nGreg, i know your group isn\'t registered with the USGA and i don\'t blame you, there is a lot of administrative paperwork that needs to be done and its only worth it if you are a larger club on campus. But that doesn\'t mean you aren\'t allowed to go to the USGA and let them know that you think what happened was rediculous and should be fixed. You should go and stand up for your rights, if that is what you truely wish to do. Go the USGA and tell them that you want more school funds diverted to maintaining our network and reducing downtime.\r\n\r\nI\'ve had problems with the campus network myself before and including this latest time, but i\'ve emailed Greg B and Alan personally without including the entire student body, and i think that is where a lot of angry with you. You mentioned that the person who works for the IT department that responded here was unprofessional in their responce to you, but i feel that you were unprofessional including the entire student body in what appears to be a rant about our technology department.',0,'1','Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.2; WOW64; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)','',0,0),(34,12,'Greg','gregory.t.brown@gmail.com','http://stonecode.org','192.132.64.2','2005-09-22 13:32:46','2005-09-22 17:32:46','My first email to the student body (which is what I suspect caused this outrage) was certainly uncalled for and overly biased.  However, the account in this article does have inforrmation that is of value to the student body which they would not otherwise have been exposed to.  You\'re certainly right when you say that by venting my frustrations to the student body and pointing the finger at the technology department was unfair.  I should have emailed them privately, collected the information, and then passed only the second email that led people here.   I do think that the information in this article (along with the voice of the student body) holds incredible value that cannot be found in direct one on one discourse or with the USGA.  My means to get here however, were indeed unprofessional, and were the result of frustration and poor judgement.\r\n\r\nIt seems as if this thread has become more of a discussion about the USGA than it is about the Network outage.  I will post a comment with a link to a thread regarding the USGA when I get a chance to start one, because I would like to voice my opinions regarding the matter and moreso (because I know little about the organization) request the opinions of others on the matter.\r\n\r\nHowever, until then, let\'s refrain from discussing the effectiveness of the USGA on this article\'s thread, as it is certainly off topic.\r\n\r\nThank you for your insightful response.',0,'1','Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0','',0,2),(35,16,'Jordan','JByro1@gmail.com','http://jordan.stonecode.org','69.177.127.78','2005-10-04 12:33:49','2005-10-04 16:33:49','How did you get those reports?

We&#8217;ve been working long and hard to bring you this release, and I hope you enjoy using it as   much as we&#8217;e enjoyed working on it. In this release we&#8217;ve focused a tremendous amount on what   we believe to be the core of blogging &#8212; the writing interface.  Before you upgrade from an earlier version, remember that this is a major release and   thousands of lines of code have changed. Before upgrading it&#8217;s always good, <em>just in   case</em>, to make a backup of your database and WordPress files. It only takes a few minutes   and gives you a total safety net if for whatever reason things don&#8217;t work. It is also probably   a good idea to turn off your plugins, and activate them one-by-one after you&#8217;ve upgraded.   Without further ado, you can <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/download/\">download WordPress 2   right now</a>. Read on for more information about what we think you&#8217;ll love about Duke.</p>\n<p><a id=\"more-177\"></a></p>\n<h3>User Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Completely Redesigned Backend</strong> &#8212; The first thing you&#8217;ll notice when you login to your   blog is the backend has been completely overhauled for both aesthetics and usability. This is   the first iteration of exciting things to come from the Shuttle team of designers that has   been volunteering their time, and look for even more aesthetic improvements in the   future.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster Administration</strong> &#8212; Call it AJAX, call it DHTML, call it Larry, but we&#8217;ve paid close   attention to streamlining some of the most common tasks in managing your blog. For example if   you&#8217;re writing a post and you can add categories on the fly, much like tagging in Flickr. Also   instead of having two separate UIs for &#8220;simple&#8221; and &#8220;advanced&#8221; posting, we&#8217;ve combined them   and let you customize the layout of the page on the fly by dragging and dropping the dialogs   around. It saves where you put things so when you return it&#8217;s just like you left it. When you   delete a comment or category it will fade out without a page load.</li>\n<li><strong>WYSIWYG Editing</strong> &#8212; WP dev Andy Skelton and the TinyMCE team have done a tremendous amount   of work to bring a smooth WYSIWYG editing experience to WordPress. As code purists, we are   very picky about what kind of HTML is generated, and while it&#8217;s not perfect yet (for instance   nested lists can cause trouble) for 95% of what you do post-to-post the WYSIWYG should save   you time. And if it doesn&#8217;t, you can turn it off on your profile page. One note: Safari and   older versions of Opera, both fantastic browsers, don&#8217;t yet support everything that&#8217;s needed   to do WYSIWYG, but we fully expect new versions of those browsers will continue to improve   their standards support, so it may just be a matter of time.</li>\n<li><strong>Included Spam and Backup Plugins</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve included two of the most popular WordPress   plugins: Skippy&#8217;s DB backup can backup your database to a file and optionally email you a   copy; Akismet is a distributed anti-spam system which gets smarter the more people use   it.</li>\n<li><strong>Resizable Editing</strong> &#8212; This is one of my personal favorite features. Ever been writing a   post and that textarea seemed a little small?

We&#8217;ve been working long and hard to bring you this release, and I hope you enjoy using it as   much as we&#8217;e enjoyed working on it. In this release we&#8217;ve focused a tremendous amount on what   we believe to be the core of blogging &#8212; the writing interface.  Before you upgrade from an earlier version, remember that this is a major release and   thousands of lines of code have changed. Before upgrading it&#8217;s always good, <em>just in   case</em>, to make a backup of your database and WordPress files. It only takes a few minutes   and gives you a total safety net if for whatever reason things don&#8217;t work. It is also probably   a good idea to turn off your plugins, and activate them one-by-one after you&#8217;ve upgraded.   Without further ado, you can <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/download/\">download WordPress 2   right now</a>. Read on for more information about what we think you&#8217;ll love about Duke.</p>\n<p><a id=\"more-177\"></a></p>\n<h3>User Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Completely Redesigned Backend</strong> &#8212; The first thing you&#8217;ll notice when you login to your   blog is the backend has been completely overhauled for both aesthetics and usability. This is   the first iteration of exciting things to come from the Shuttle team of designers that has   been volunteering their time, and look for even more aesthetic improvements in the   future.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster Administration</strong> &#8212; Call it AJAX, call it DHTML, call it Larry, but we&#8217;ve paid close   attention to streamlining some of the most common tasks in managing your blog. For example if   you&#8217;re writing a post and you can add categories on the fly, much like tagging in Flickr. Also   instead of having two separate UIs for &#8220;simple&#8221; and &#8220;advanced&#8221; posting, we&#8217;ve combined them   and let you customize the layout of the page on the fly by dragging and dropping the dialogs   around. It saves where you put things so when you return it&#8217;s just like you left it. When you   delete a comment or category it will fade out without a page load.</li>\n<li><strong>WYSIWYG Editing</strong> &#8212; WP dev Andy Skelton and the TinyMCE team have done a tremendous amount   of work to bring a smooth WYSIWYG editing experience to WordPress. As code purists, we are   very picky about what kind of HTML is generated, and while it&#8217;s not perfect yet (for instance   nested lists can cause trouble) for 95% of what you do post-to-post the WYSIWYG should save   you time. And if it doesn&#8217;t, you can turn it off on your profile page. One note: Safari and   older versions of Opera, both fantastic browsers, don&#8217;t yet support everything that&#8217;s needed   to do WYSIWYG, but we fully expect new versions of those browsers will continue to improve   their standards support, so it may just be a matter of time.</li>\n<li><strong>Included Spam and Backup Plugins</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve included two of the most popular WordPress   plugins: Skippy&#8217;s DB backup can backup your database to a file and optionally email you a   copy; Akismet is a distributed anti-spam system which gets smarter the more people use   it.</li>\n<li><strong>Resizable Editing</strong> &#8212; This is one of my personal favorite features. Ever been writing a   post and that textarea seemed a little small? Happens to me all the time, and our new rich   text editor includes a feature that lets you resize the editor on-the-fly by clicking on the   corner, just like a regular window.</li>\n<li><strong>Inline Uploading</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve optimized our uploader for image, audio, and video files and   put it inline with the posting screen. You don&#8217;t have to bounce around any more when writing a   post! It also will organize your files for you as you upload them to make them easier to find   later.

If upgrading poses a problem for some reason, and if you don&#8217;t need pingbacks or blog client API functionality, simply delete the class-xmlrpc.php and class-xmlrpcs.php files from your installation&#8217;s wp-includes directory (but you really should upgrade).</p>\n<p>Also if you ever come across something you feel might be a security problem in WordPress, please send a note to <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/about/contact/\">the special address we&#8217;ve set up for security purposes</a> and we will address it as quickly as possible.  </p>\n\";}i:4;a:12:{s:5:\"title\";s:8:\"Bug Hunt\";s:4:\"link\";s:50:\"http://wordpress.org/development/2005/11/bug-hunt/\";s:8:\"comments\";s:59:\"http://wordpress.org/development/2005/11/bug-hunt/#comments\";s:7:\"pubdate\";s:31:\"Thu, 03 Nov 2005 16:28:04 +0000\";s:2:\"dc\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";s:4:\"Matt\";}s:8:\"category\";s:17:\"DevelopmentEvents\";s:4:\"guid\";s:50:\"http://wordpress.org/development/2005/11/bug-hunt/\";s:11:\"description\";s:347:\"You are invited to the WordPress Bug Hunt on Saturday, November 5th, 2005!\nWhether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a die-hard WordPress hacker or just looking to gain some familiarity with WordPress internals, we need your help!

We&#8217;ve been working long and hard to bring you this release, and I hope you enjoy using it as   much as we&#8217;e enjoyed working on it. In this release we&#8217;ve focused a tremendous amount on what   we believe to be the core of blogging &#8212; the writing interface.  Before you upgrade from an earlier version, remember that this is a major release and   thousands of lines of code have changed. Before upgrading it&#8217;s always good, <em>just in   case</em>, to make a backup of your database and WordPress files. It only takes a few minutes   and gives you a total safety net if for whatever reason things don&#8217;t work. It is also probably   a good idea to turn off your plugins, and activate them one-by-one after you&#8217;ve upgraded.   Without further ado, you can <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/download/\">download WordPress 2   right now</a>. Read on for more information about what we think you&#8217;ll love about Duke.</p>\n<p><a id=\"more-177\"></a></p>\n<h3>User Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Completely Redesigned Backend</strong> &#8212; The first thing you&#8217;ll notice when you login to your   blog is the backend has been completely overhauled for both aesthetics and usability. This is   the first iteration of exciting things to come from the Shuttle team of designers that has   been volunteering their time, and look for even more aesthetic improvements in the   future.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster Administration</strong> &#8212; Call it AJAX, call it DHTML, call it Larry, but we&#8217;ve paid close   attention to streamlining some of the most common tasks in managing your blog. For example if   you&#8217;re writing a post and you can add categories on the fly, much like tagging in Flickr. Also   instead of having two separate UIs for &#8220;simple&#8221; and &#8220;advanced&#8221; posting, we&#8217;ve combined them   and let you customize the layout of the page on the fly by dragging and dropping the dialogs   around. It saves where you put things so when you return it&#8217;s just like you left it. When you   delete a comment or category it will fade out without a page load.</li>\n<li><strong>WYSIWYG Editing</strong> &#8212; WP dev Andy Skelton and the TinyMCE team have done a tremendous amount   of work to bring a smooth WYSIWYG editing experience to WordPress. As code purists, we are   very picky about what kind of HTML is generated, and while it&#8217;s not perfect yet (for instance   nested lists can cause trouble) for 95% of what you do post-to-post the WYSIWYG should save   you time. And if it doesn&#8217;t, you can turn it off on your profile page. One note: Safari and   older versions of Opera, both fantastic browsers, don&#8217;t yet support everything that&#8217;s needed   to do WYSIWYG, but we fully expect new versions of those browsers will continue to improve   their standards support, so it may just be a matter of time.</li>\n<li><strong>Included Spam and Backup Plugins</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve included two of the most popular WordPress   plugins: Skippy&#8217;s DB backup can backup your database to a file and optionally email you a   copy; Akismet is a distributed anti-spam system which gets smarter the more people use   it.</li>\n<li><strong>Resizable Editing</strong> &#8212; This is one of my personal favorite features. Ever been writing a   post and that textarea seemed a little small? Happens to me all the time, and our new rich   text editor includes a feature that lets you resize the editor on-the-fly by clicking on the   corner, just like a regular window.</li>\n<li><strong>Inline Uploading</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve optimized our uploader for image, audio, and video files and   put it inline with the posting screen. You don&#8217;t have to bounce around any more when writing a   post! It also will organize your files for you as you upload them to make them easier to find   later. On the backend, each uploaded file is actually a &#8220;sub-post&#8221; so it can have individual   comments and pingbacks, its own permalink, and even a custom template based on what type of   file it is. You can click on attached files to get a menu of options, or if you&#8217;re on Firefox   you can drag and drop them into your WYSIWYG editor.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster Posting</strong> &#8212; In the past if you were linking to a number of posts or pinging a lot   of update services, your posting time could appear to slow to a crawl even though everything   was instantly done on the backend. We&#8217;ve modified how this works now so posting should be   near-instantaneous, like everything else in WordPress.</li>\n<li><strong>Post Preview</strong> &#8212; Another enhancement to the post screen, now when you save a post it shows   a live preview of how the post would look on your site, with the stylesheet and theme and   everything. No more publishing a post just to see if it works.</li>\n<li><strong>Streamlined Importing</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve rewritten our import system from the ground up to be much   easier to use (you no longer have to edit files), put it behind authentication, and also made   it easy for new importers to be dropped into the system, much like plugins.</li>\n<li><strong>User Roles</strong> &#8212; We had a ton of feedback on our old numerical user level system. No one was   exactly sure what those numbers meant! We&#8217;ve distilled the basic functions into a set of roles   &#8212; such as administrator, editor, contributor &#8212; that make it easier to understand what sort   of capabilities you&#8217;re giving your blog&#8217;s users. The new system is completely pluggable too,   so plugins can modify roles and create groups that have access to certain things.</li>\n<li><strong>Header Customization</strong> &#8212; If you&#8217;re tired of the blue header in the default theme, you can   now change the colors and text of it, which we&#8217;ve included as a demo of some of the new   features available to theme authors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Developer Features</h3>\n<p>On the backend we&#8217;ve done a ton of changes to clean up code, make things more consistent, and   enable a lot of new types of applications to be built on top of WordPress.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>User Level Options</strong> &#8212; You can now store options on a <em>per-user</em> level rather than   having them apply for the entire blog. An example of this in WP2 is with the rich text editor,   which can be turned on or off per a user&#8217;s discretion.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Abstraction</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve eliminated almost all direct SQL queries from the code and   moved them to functions and classes that make the entire program more consistent.</li>\n<li><strong>Built-in Caching</strong> &#8212; WordPress now includes a completely pluggable object cache system   that cuts the number of queries most pages do in half. By default it is disk-based, but there   is already a plugin to use memcached and we expect more are on their way. We&#8217;ve only begun to   tap into this.</li>\n<li><strong>Plugin Hooks Galore</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve added hooks for plugin authors wherever we could think to,   so what you&#8217;re able to do in the new system is pretty dramatic. Ne features like the WYSIWYG   and the inline uploader are completely pluggable and can be replaced entirely.</li>\n<li><strong>Import Framework</strong> &#8212; The new import framework allows you to create an importer with about   a third of the code you used to need, and it can have a consistent interface with no extra   work.</li>\n<li><strong>Theme Functions</strong> &#8212; Themes can now include a functions.php file that will now be loaded   like a plugin attached to the theme.</li>\n<li><strong>Theme preview images</strong> &#8212; You can now include a screenshot of the theme with the download   so in the WP interface your users will see a quick preview of what it looks like.</li>\n<li><strong>Hundreds and Hundreds of Bug Fixes</strong> &#8212; <a href=\"http://trac.wordpress.org/milestone/2.0\">2.0 has hundreds of tracked bugs and   enhancements</a>, many that are very subtle.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may have noticed our design has changed quite a bit. We&#8217;ve also moved <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\">WordPress.org</a> to a newer, faster server. There were a few issues with the move which is why we&#8217;ve held off for a few days on announcing 2.0. Everything seems to be smooth sailing now.\n</p>\";s:7:\"pubdate\";s:31:\"Sat, 31 Dec 2005 00:47:10 +0000\";s:7:\"summary\";s:8670:\"<p>The WordPress community is very proud to present the next generation of WordPress to the   world, our 2.0 &#8220;Duke&#8221; release, named in honor of jazz pianist and composer <a href=\"http://www.dukeellington.com/\">Duke Ellington</a>.

Read on for more information about what we think you&#8217;ll love about Duke.</p>\n<p><a id=\"more-177\"></a></p>\n<h3>User Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Completely Redesigned Backend</strong> &#8212; The first thing you&#8217;ll notice when you login to your   blog is the backend has been completely overhauled for both aesthetics and usability. This is   the first iteration of exciting things to come from the Shuttle team of designers that has   been volunteering their time, and look for even more aesthetic improvements in the   future.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster Administration</strong> &#8212; Call it AJAX, call it DHTML, call it Larry, but we&#8217;ve paid close   attention to streamlining some of the most common tasks in managing your blog. For example if   you&#8217;re writing a post and you can add categories on the fly, much like tagging in Flickr. Also   instead of having two separate UIs for &#8220;simple&#8221; and &#8220;advanced&#8221; posting, we&#8217;ve combined them   and let you customize the layout of the page on the fly by dragging and dropping the dialogs   around. It saves where you put things so when you return it&#8217;s just like you left it. When you   delete a comment or category it will fade out without a page load.</li>\n<li><strong>WYSIWYG Editing</strong> &#8212; WP dev Andy Skelton and the TinyMCE team have done a tremendous amount   of work to bring a smooth WYSIWYG editing experience to WordPress. As code purists, we are   very picky about what kind of HTML is generated, and while it&#8217;s not perfect yet (for instance   nested lists can cause trouble) for 95% of what you do post-to-post the WYSIWYG should save   you time. And if it doesn&#8217;t, you can turn it off on your profile page. One note: Safari and   older versions of Opera, both fantastic browsers, don&#8217;t yet support everything that&#8217;s needed   to do WYSIWYG, but we fully expect new versions of those browsers will continue to improve   their standards support, so it may just be a matter of time.</li>\n<li><strong>Included Spam and Backup Plugins</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve included two of the most popular WordPress   plugins: Skippy&#8217;s DB backup can backup your database to a file and optionally email you a   copy; Akismet is a distributed anti-spam system which gets smarter the more people use   it.</li>\n<li><strong>Resizable Editing</strong> &#8212; This is one of my personal favorite features. Ever been writing a   post and that textarea seemed a little small? Happens to me all the time, and our new rich   text editor includes a feature that lets you resize the editor on-the-fly by clicking on the   corner, just like a regular window.</li>\n<li><strong>Inline Uploading</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve optimized our uploader for image, audio, and video files and   put it inline with the posting screen. You don&#8217;t have to bounce around any more when writing a   post! It also will organize your files for you as you upload them to make them easier to find   later. On the backend, each uploaded file is actually a &#8220;sub-post&#8221; so it can have individual   comments and pingbacks, its own permalink, and even a custom template based on what type of   file it is. You can click on attached files to get a menu of options, or if you&#8217;re on Firefox   you can drag and drop them into your WYSIWYG editor.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster Posting</strong> &#8212; In the past if you were linking to a number of posts or pinging a lot   of update services, your posting time could appear to slow to a crawl even though everything   was instantly done on the backend. We&#8217;ve modified how this works now so posting should be   near-instantaneous, like everything else in WordPress.</li>\n<li><strong>Post Preview</strong> &#8212; Another enhancement to the post screen, now when you save a post it shows   a live preview of how the post would look on your site, with the stylesheet and theme and   everything. No more publishing a post just to see if it works.</li>\n<li><strong>Streamlined Importing</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve rewritten our import system from the ground up to be much   easier to use (you no longer have to edit files), put it behind authentication, and also made   it easy for new importers to be dropped into the system, much like plugins.</li>\n<li><strong>User Roles</strong> &#8212; We had a ton of feedback on our old numerical user level system. No one was   exactly sure what those numbers meant! We&#8217;ve distilled the basic functions into a set of roles   &#8212; such as administrator, editor, contributor &#8212; that make it easier to understand what sort   of capabilities you&#8217;re giving your blog&#8217;s users. The new system is completely pluggable too,   so plugins can modify roles and create groups that have access to certain things.</li>\n<li><strong>Header Customization</strong> &#8212; If you&#8217;re tired of the blue header in the default theme, you can   now change the colors and text of it, which we&#8217;ve included as a demo of some of the new   features available to theme authors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Developer Features</h3>\n<p>On the backend we&#8217;ve done a ton of changes to clean up code, make things more consistent, and   enable a lot of new types of applications to be built on top of WordPress.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>User Level Options</strong> &#8212; You can now store options on a <em>per-user</em> level rather than   having them apply for the entire blog. An example of this in WP2 is with the rich text editor,   which can be turned on or off per a user&#8217;s discretion.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Abstraction</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve eliminated almost all direct SQL queries from the code and   moved them to functions and classes that make the entire program more consistent.</li>\n<li><strong>Built-in Caching</strong> &#8212; WordPress now includes a completely pluggable object cache system   that cuts the number of queries most pages do in half. By default it is disk-based, but there   is already a plugin to use memcached and we expect more are on their way. We&#8217;ve only begun to   tap into this.</li>\n<li><strong>Plugin Hooks Galore</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve added hooks for plugin authors wherever we could think to,   so what you&#8217;re able to do in the new system is pretty dramatic. Ne features like the WYSIWYG   and the inline uploader are completely pluggable and can be replaced entirely.</li>\n<li><strong>Import Framework</strong> &#8212; The new import framework allows you to create an importer with about   a third of the code you used to need, and it can have a consistent interface with no extra   work.</li>\n<li><strong>Theme Functions</strong> &#8212; Themes can now include a functions.php file that will now be loaded   like a plugin attached to the theme.</li>\n<li><strong>Theme preview images</strong> &#8212; You can now include a screenshot of the theme with the download   so in the WP interface your users will see a quick preview of what it looks like.</li>\n<li><strong>Hundreds and Hundreds of Bug Fixes</strong> &#8212; <a href=\"http://trac.wordpress.org/milestone/2.0\">2.0 has hundreds of tracked bugs and   enhancements</a>, many that are very subtle.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may have noticed our design has changed quite a bit. We&#8217;ve also moved <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\">WordPress.org</a> to a newer, faster server. There were a few issues with the move which is why we&#8217;ve held off for a few days on announcing 2.0.

Hint: Search for your product on the web, find bloggers who talk about your product, make these bloggers happy and your product will get free and positive advertising.\n</li>\n	<li>\nI would like to see bloggers make more profit from their blogs. Adsense is already very viable and many bloggers are already making a killing, but there is more money to go around. Advertising and profit sharing with bloggers would make casual bloggers very happy. Happy bloggers == better content == better blogosphere.\n</li>\n	<li>\nI was wowed by Flickr and Memorandum. I would really like to see more innovative apps that focus on the blogging world and the social network that is blogging.\n</li>\n	<li>\nPodcasting is nice in its own arena, but I just dont think I want every blog to become a podcast. Yet, I crave multimedia in blogging. I would really like to be surprised.\n</li>\n	<li>\nMSN Spaces scare me. Asian blog networks are even worse. Not sure what I wish for them, but I have yet to read a single blog on any of those networks that I come back to.\n</li>\n	<li>\nLess network, more blog.\n</li>\n	<li>\nI really would like to see Wordpress do better, even better than it already is. This is a personal wish. I am not sure why I have this affinity towards Wordpress et al, but I do.\n</li>\n	<li>\nAkismet is just frickin wonderful. This time next year, I hope to be deleting even lesser spam than I do today.\n</li>\n	<li>\nYahoo! has the right idea when they added Wordpress to their hosting lineup. I would like to see larger financial players help out and spread the wealth among Open Source initiatives in the blogging world and beyond. Free work for OSS is nice, but a little money to ice the cake is always just that much better.\n</li>\n	<li>\nFinally, I would like to see more and better content. Well written personal blogs are refreshing reads.\n</li>\n	</ul>\n<span class=\"technoratitags\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://www.technorati.com/tag/blogging+wishlist+for+2006\" rel=\"tag\">blogging wishlist for 2006</a>\";s:7:\"pubdate\";s:31:\"Fri, 30 Dec 2005 11:51:49 +0000\";s:7:\"summary\";s:3062:\"<p>Yes, I lifted the idea from <a href=\"http://bloombergmarketing.blogs.com/bloomberg_marketing/2005/12/2.html\">another blog</a> since their focus was somewhere else. </p>\n	<p>Here is my blogging wishlist for 2006.

Search engines could also play an important role in this.\n</li>\n	<li>\nSince blogging is already popular, I would like to see corporations using existing blogs to leverage sales and tweak their offerings to make bloggers happy. Hint: Search for your product on the web, find bloggers who talk about your product, make these bloggers happy and your product will get free and positive advertising.\n</li>\n	<li>\nI would like to see bloggers make more profit from their blogs. Adsense is already very viable and many bloggers are already making a killing, but there is more money to go around. Advertising and profit sharing with bloggers would make casual bloggers very happy. Happy bloggers == better content == better blogosphere.\n</li>\n	<li>\nI was wowed by Flickr and Memorandum. I would really like to see more innovative apps that focus on the blogging world and the social network that is blogging.\n</li>\n	<li>\nPodcasting is nice in its own arena, but I just dont think I want every blog to become a podcast. Yet, I crave multimedia in blogging. I would really like to be surprised.\n</li>\n	<li>\nMSN Spaces scare me. Asian blog networks are even worse. Not sure what I wish for them, but I have yet to read a single blog on any of those networks that I come back to.\n</li>\n	<li>\nLess network, more blog.\n</li>\n	<li>\nI really would like to see Wordpress do better, even better than it already is. This is a personal wish. I am not sure why I have this affinity towards Wordpress et al, but I do.\n</li>\n	<li>\nAkismet is just frickin wonderful. This time next year, I hope to be deleting even lesser spam than I do today.\n</li>\n	<li>\nYahoo! has the right idea when they added Wordpress to their hosting lineup. I would like to see larger financial players help out and spread the wealth among Open Source initiatives in the blogging world and beyond. Free work for OSS is nice, but a little money to ice the cake is always just that much better.\n</li>\n	<li>\nFinally, I would like to see more and better content. Well written personal blogs are refreshing reads.\n</li>\n	</ul>\n<span class=\"technoratitags\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://www.technorati.com/tag/blogging+wishlist+for+2006\" rel=\"tag\">blogging wishlist for 2006</a>\";}i:9;a:6:{s:5:\"title\";s:19:\"Matt: In Cincinnati\";s:4:\"guid\";s:46:\"http://photomatt.net/2005/12/29/in-cincinnati/\";s:4:\"link\";s:46:\"http://photomatt.net/2005/12/29/in-cincinnati/\";s:11:\"description\";s:753:\"<p>I&#8217;m in the Cincinnati airport, and they just announced an emergency.

Possibly?<br />\n<a id=\"more-2171\"></a><br />\nThis is also known as the dreaded question, &#8220;In what way is WordPress 2.0 going to break my site and cause me hours of upgrade pain without someone to whom I can whimper, &#8216;Please, make it go again.&#8217;?&#8221;</p>\n<p>This post isn&#8217;t going to make that question much easier, but I may provide a toll-free support number for handling these issues before the week is out.</p>\n<p>There is a user-supplied list of plugins that will/will not work with WordPress 2.0 over on <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Matt/2.0_Plugin_Compatibility\">photomatt&#8217;s Codex user page</a>.  I hope that this page gets rolled into the main site soon because it&#8217;s a little off the beaten path.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the good news:  Themes are probably OK.  Unless your theme was doing something crazy before, it&#8217;s probably going to work after the upgrade.  There have been a lot of new plugin hooks added to the 2.0 version, but it doesn&#8217;t seem like anything made it into the theme system that would cause it to break.</p>\n<p>The theme system does allow for a custom plugin-like set of functions to be loaded.  WordPress will automatically load a file named functions.php for any theme that includes one.  This is done in the same way that plugins are loaded, and allows themes to supply their own custom features, including both output functions and configuration pages.</p>\n<p>Also, themes should now come with &#8220;thumbnail&#8221; images (I say &#8220;thumbnail&#8221; in quotes because they&#8217;re actually more the size of your palm, but&#8230;) that will be displayed in the admin.  If your theme doesn&#8217;t have one, it&#8217;ll simply show a blank box.</p>\n<p>A theme that doesn&#8217;t have either one of these should load just as it did in WordPress 1.5.2, but won&#8217;t have those additional features.</p>\n<p><strong>Plugins are another question, though.</strong>  There are some specific sections of WordPress that have been heavily revised.  If you use a plugin that integrates into one of these sections, it will probably not work.  Specifically, the permissions and capability sections will be a bear for plugins that are affected by user levels.</p>\n<p>If you are running a &#8220;view level&#8221; plugin - something that restricts a reader&#8217;s permissions to access certain posts - I&#8217;ll say straight out right now that unless you&#8217;ve got a brand new version (and I know of no author who has written one of these plugins that is offering an updated version) it&#8217;s not going to work.  If you have an update, comment here - I&#8217;m looking for it myself.</p>\n<p>One often overlooked aspect of this is that any plugin that uses an admin page will need review.  The function call that adds custom admin pages used to require a user level number.  It now requires a capability name.  Now there are some backwards-compatibility checks for user levels in there, but they may obviously not work as well as something specifically designed to work with the new capabilities system.</p>\n<p>Also in the administration area, if you are using a plugin that hooks into the editor, you may have issues with it.  This is particularly so if that plugin adds buttons to the Quicktag toolbar, since the new default is to use the WYSIWYG editor, which does not use the same toolbar.</p>\n<p>I have written the <a href=\"http://redalt.com/downloads/wp2/buttonsnap.zip\">buttonsnap class</a>, which lets plugin authors add buttons to both editors very easily.  It&#8217;s not a plugin itself, but a library that makes it very simple for plugin authors to create buttons in either editor with a simple, single function call.  Still, the plugin will have to be rewritten to use my library or some other solution if it&#8217;s going to be effectual.</p>\n<p>If your plugins use DOM to insert new elements into the user interface (pretty much any plugin that adds elements is using DOM to do it) then it may need to be updated to account for changes there.</p>\n<p>The Upload page in the admin is gone.  If your plugin altered or attached to that page, it won&#8217;t be any more.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, you&#8217;re going to need to procure write access for your server to the /wp-content directory of WordPress.  That means you have to allow your server to write files into that directory from scripts.  This will allow things like caching, image uploading, and the bundled backup plugin to work as they should, although your host may not like it or allow it (most hosts will, but you should check), and you might not consider it secure to leave all of the subdirectories there in that state.</p>\n<p>You should verify with someone you trust concerning the permissions you intend to use to provide the access to your server that you want to provide.</p>\n<p><strong>What should you do if your plugin doesn&#8217;t work?</strong></p>\n<p>Panic.</p>\n<p>Nah, just kidding.  Actually, before you upgrade, compare the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Matt/2.0_Plugin_Compatibility\">list of working plugins</a> against the ones you&#8217;re using.  If your doesn&#8217;t appear in the &#8220;known working&#8221; section of list, you need to talk to someone.</p>\n<p>Your best bet, if you can find contact info, is to badger the plugin author.  Barring that, you can try any of the standard <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support\">support channels</a>, but be aware that in the fallout that is bound to occur when everyone upgrades, your 3rd-party code (code written by someone outside of the WordPress core) isn&#8217;t going to be a priority.</p>\n<p>I suggest trying WordPress IRC (#wordpress @ irc.freenode.net) and see if anyone there knows how to solve your problem.  There is usually someone there that can at least record the issue or forward it on to someone who can start fixing.</p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t been keeping up with documentation on 2.0 as well as I should, but I imagine that with the frequency of changes over the past month or two that nothing is verifiably up to date.  If you find instructions in the Codex for performing some necessary intrinsic system change, first be sure that the instructions apply to the version you are installing.</p>\n<p>Probably the most sound advice I can give you is this:  If you have any doubt about performing an upgrade - <em>don&#8217;t upgrade!</em>  There&#8217;s no reason to submit yourself as a guinea pig to test this software, especially if you&#8217;re fairly satisfied with what you have already.  Granted, WordPress 2.0 is a nice piece of work, but it&#8217;s going to be a while before 1.5.2 loses the support of the community at large.</p>\n<p>Take your time.  Learn from the mistakes of the 500,000 other downloaders.  After that, take the plunge.</p>\n<p>Remember to <em>backup everything</em>.</p>\n<p>Shameless plug: There are also people who can <a href=\"http://shimmerstudio.net\">do your upgrade for you</a>.</p>\n<p>If any of you developers think of any other &#8220;gotchas&#8221; in the new system, please leave them in the comments.  Thanks!</p>\n<p>Otherwise, I&#8217;ll see you in WP 2.0 later this week.  I&#8217;ve got at least two plugins for 2.0 that I hope to have baked for the release.

This will allow things like caching, image uploading, and the bundled backup plugin to work as they should, although your host may not like it or allow it (most hosts will, but you should check), and you might not consider it secure to leave all of the subdirectories there in that state.</p>\n<p>You should verify with someone you trust concerning the permissions you intend to use to provide the access to your server that you want to provide.</p>\n<p><strong>What should you do if your plugin doesn&#8217;t work?</strong></p>\n<p>Panic.</p>\n<p>Nah, just kidding.  Actually, before you upgrade, compare the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Matt/2.0_Plugin_Compatibility\">list of working plugins</a> against the ones you&#8217;re using.  If your doesn&#8217;t appear in the &#8220;known working&#8221; section of list, you need to talk to someone.</p>\n<p>Your best bet, if you can find contact info, is to badger the plugin author.  Barring that, you can try any of the standard <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support\">support channels</a>, but be aware that in the fallout that is bound to occur when everyone upgrades, your 3rd-party code (code written by someone outside of the WordPress core) isn&#8217;t going to be a priority.</p>\n<p>I suggest trying WordPress IRC (#wordpress @ irc.freenode.net) and see if anyone there knows how to solve your problem.  There is usually someone there that can at least record the issue or forward it on to someone who can start fixing.</p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t been keeping up with documentation on 2.0 as well as I should, but I imagine that with the frequency of changes over the past month or two that nothing is verifiably up to date.  If you find instructions in the Codex for performing some necessary intrinsic system change, first be sure that the instructions apply to the version you are installing.</p>\n<p>Probably the most sound advice I can give you is this:  If you have any doubt about performing an upgrade - <em>don&#8217;t upgrade!</em>  There&#8217;s no reason to submit yourself as a guinea pig to test this software, especially if you&#8217;re fairly satisfied with what you have already.  Granted, WordPress 2.0 is a nice piece of work, but it&#8217;s going to be a while before 1.5.2 loses the support of the community at large.</p>\n<p>Take your time.  Learn from the mistakes of the 500,000 other downloaders.  After that, take the plunge.</p>\n<p>Remember to <em>backup everything</em>.</p>\n<p>Shameless plug: There are also people who can <a href=\"http://shimmerstudio.net\">do your upgrade for you</a>.</p>\n<p>If any of you developers think of any other &#8220;gotchas&#8221; in the new system, please leave them in the comments.  Thanks!</p>\n<p>Otherwise, I&#8217;ll see you in WP 2.0 later this week.  I&#8217;ve got at least two plugins for 2.0 that I hope to have baked for the release.  I&#8217;m also looking forward to the sleek new <a href=\"http://wordpress.org\">WordPress.org</a> <a href=\"http://photomatt.net/temp/wordpress-v2.png\">site redesign/rebranding</a> we were promised with the new version release.\n</p>\";}i:27;a:6:{s:5:\"title\";s:69:\"Owen Winkler: WordPress and Philly Blogger Meetup Accosted by Santas!\";s:4:\"guid\";s:95:\"http://asymptomatic.net/2005/12/19/2169/wordpress-and-philly-blogger-meetup-accosted-by-santas/\";s:4:\"link\";s:95:\"http://asymptomatic.net/2005/12/19/2169/wordpress-and-philly-blogger-meetup-accosted-by-santas/\";s:11:\"description\";s:5698:\"<p>Ah, the depressing dearth of WordPress meetup attendees this month was quite offset by the Philly Blogger meetup that happened afterward.</p>\n<p>First, let&#8217;s give props to the gang that showed up, and then I&#8217;ll tell you all about the <strong>crazy Irish dancing and Santa invasion</strong> that you missed when you left early.</p>\n<p>This list is mostly copied from <a href=\"http://www.phillyfuture.org/node/2313\">the list at Philly Future</a>, kindly collected and posted by <a href=\"http://blog.blankbaby.com/\">Scott</a>, and modified only slightly to point at posts talking about the meetup:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Michael from <a href=\"http://g33k.efamilynj.org/\">Just another Geek&#8217;s Blog</a></li>\n<li>Dan from <a href=\"http://willdo.philadelphiaweekly.com/\">philadelphia will do</a></li>\n<li>Mystery blogger from <a href=\"http://thewestend.blogspot.com/\">The West End</a></li>\n<li>Tulin from <a href=\"http://www.politicsphilly.com/\">PoliticsPhilly</a></li>\n<li>Duncan from <a href=\"http://atrios.blogspot.com/\">Eschaton</a></li>\n<li>Albert from <a href=\"http://dragonballyee.blogs.com/\">philly</a> and <a href=\"http://www.messyandpicky.com/\">Messy and Picky</a></li>\n<li>Tony from <a href=\"http://merecat.org/\">Mere Cat</a></li>\n<li>Michael from <a href=\"http://rivertyde.com/\">River Tyde</a></li>\n<li>Marisa from <a href=\"http://apt2024.blogspot.com/\">Apartment 2024</a> and <a href=\"http://philadelphia.metblogs.com/2005/12/the_philly_blog.phtml\">Metroblogging Philadelphia</a></li>\n<li>Bobby from <a href=\"http://somethingunpredictable.com/archives/18/12/2005/philadelphia-wordpress-and-webloggers-meetups/\">Something Unpredictable</a></li>\n<li>Luna from <a href=\"http://phillyam.blogspot.com/2005/12/december-blogger-meetup.html\">Strolling Luna</a></li>\n<li>Howard from <a href=\"http://thesmedleylog.com/\">the smedley log</a></li>\n<li>Scott from <a href=\"http://blog.blankbaby.com/\">Blankbaby</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>And now, photos, movies, and &#8220;Run for your lives!

I suppose if you&#8217;re not sure something is a bug, it might be worthwhile to ask someone else (I would ask on IRC at #wordpress on irc.freenode.net) but it really is better to have a formal record of an issue, even if it turns out that what you&#8217;re experiencing is expected behavior.  If you really fear that it&#8217;s something to do specifically with your installation, check on IRC or maybe try a fresh install.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, it might be useful to folks to learn how I do it.  I&#8217;m not saying my method is <em>correct</em>, just that it seems to get the job done with few complaints from the devs who commit my patches.  It&#8217;s also a good method to use on Windows.  (Sorry, someone else can document command-line Subversion use - not that I don&#8217;t know it, I&#8217;m just lazy.)  Here we go&#8230;<br />\n<a id=\"more-2142\"></a></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what you need to do to get an environment that is ripe for making source modifications:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Get a WordPress.org Support Forum Login</strong> - You need a <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/register.php\">support forum login</a> to gain access to Trac.  <a href=\"http://trac.wordpress.org\">Trac</a> is the software WordPress uses for bug tracking, and it shares its login database with the support forum.</li>\n<li><strong>Download and Install Tortoise SVN</strong> - <a href=\"http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/\">Tortoise</a> is the best Subversion client for Windows.  It will let you get the latest source from the code repository without messing with funky nightly versions.</li>\n<li><strong>Install XAMPP</strong> - If you&#8217;re not already running Apache locally, you&#8217;re going to need it.  You can test under Microsoft&#8217;s IIS (and this is probably not a bad idea considering there are fewer people testing that environment) but if you&#8217;re not running Windows XP Pro (not Home), you may find this difficult.  <a href=\"http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html\">XAMPP</a> is Apache, MySQL, PHP and some other thing you don&#8217;t need for WordPress all rolled into one bundle.</li>\n<li><strong>Checkout a Copy of WordPress</strong> - Find the directory that XAMPP is using for its DocumentRoot and right-click on it (or create a &#8220;wordpress&#8221; directory there and right-click on that).  Select <em>SVN Checkout&#8230;</em>.  In the dialog, use http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/trunk as the repository URL.  Click OK to download the latest WordPress source.</li>\n<li><strong>Make a Database</strong> - Use phpMyAdmin to create a new database for WordPress.  Navigate to http://localhost/phpmyadmin to see the interface.</li>\n<li><strong>Run the WordPress Install</strong> - I trust you already know how to do this.  If not, then perhaps patching is a bit advanced, no?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ok, now WordPress is running.  You should be able to do anything that you normally do with WordPress.</p>\n<p>At this point, you can modify code freely.

I suppose if you&#8217;re not sure something is a bug, it might be worthwhile to ask someone else (I would ask on IRC at #wordpress on irc.freenode.net) but it really is better to have a formal record of an issue, even if it turns out that what you&#8217;re experiencing is expected behavior.  If you really fear that it&#8217;s something to do specifically with your installation, check on IRC or maybe try a fresh install.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, it might be useful to folks to learn how I do it.  I&#8217;m not saying my method is <em>correct</em>, just that it seems to get the job done with few complaints from the devs who commit my patches.  It&#8217;s also a good method to use on Windows.  (Sorry, someone else can document command-line Subversion use - not that I don&#8217;t know it, I&#8217;m just lazy.)  Here we go&#8230;<br />\n<a id=\"more-2142\"></a></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what you need to do to get an environment that is ripe for making source modifications:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Get a WordPress.org Support Forum Login</strong> - You need a <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/register.php\">support forum login</a> to gain access to Trac.  <a href=\"http://trac.wordpress.org\">Trac</a> is the software WordPress uses for bug tracking, and it shares its login database with the support forum.</li>\n<li><strong>Download and Install Tortoise SVN</strong> - <a href=\"http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/\">Tortoise</a> is the best Subversion client for Windows.  It will let you get the latest source from the code repository without messing with funky nightly versions.</li>\n<li><strong>Install XAMPP</strong> - If you&#8217;re not already running Apache locally, you&#8217;re going to need it.  You can test under Microsoft&#8217;s IIS (and this is probably not a bad idea considering there are fewer people testing that environment) but if you&#8217;re not running Windows XP Pro (not Home), you may find this difficult.  <a href=\"http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html\">XAMPP</a> is Apache, MySQL, PHP and some other thing you don&#8217;t need for WordPress all rolled into one bundle.</li>\n<li><strong>Checkout a Copy of WordPress</strong> - Find the directory that XAMPP is using for its DocumentRoot and right-click on it (or create a &#8220;wordpress&#8221; directory there and right-click on that).  Select <em>SVN Checkout&#8230;</em>.  In the dialog, use http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/trunk as the repository URL.  Click OK to download the latest WordPress source.</li>\n<li><strong>Make a Database</strong> - Use phpMyAdmin to create a new database for WordPress.  Navigate to http://localhost/phpmyadmin to see the interface.</li>\n<li><strong>Run the WordPress Install</strong> - I trust you already know how to do this.  If not, then perhaps patching is a bit advanced, no?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ok, now WordPress is running.  You should be able to do anything that you normally do with WordPress.</p>\n<p>At this point, you can modify code freely.  If you make a change you don&#8217;t like, you can always switch back to the original code.

They are things that you&#8217;re not going to notice unless you are developer.  There are some features that casual users will notice that are significant, but (in my opinion) most of the real change has happened where most people won&#8217;t see.</p>\n<p>As a result, there is a fundamental thing to understand here.  What often looks like catering to plugin developers is actually of benefit to common users, because with the enhanced capabilities of the underlying engine it becomes possible to make better extensions faster than we could before.  The underlying engine has been made to work <em>better</em>.  There have been times while doing contract work on 1.5.x installations where two days of work were necessary to accomplish something that I could have done in 1.6 (now 2.0) in about 10 minutes.  Seriously.</p>\n<p>There has been a lot of talk in the WP scene about feature bloat, and it&#8217;s my own opinion that certain aspects of 2.0 are wildly overrated for what they do, but from an underlying technology standpoint, WordPress 2.0 is incredibly superior to the 1.5 codebase.</p>\n<p>So if you don&#8217;t want to upgrade because you don&#8217;t think that 2.0 offers you anything, just wait a couple months until the really fun plugins start appearing.</p>\n<p>Enough said on that.  On with the new features list, which is by no means comprehensive:<br />\n<a id=\"more-2135\"></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>More Abstracted Data Layer</strong> - The core WordPress code has been refactored to abstract direct calls to the database when adding posts, comments, and other data.  This will lead to improvements in database access (perhaps even supporting other database engines in the future) and plugin development, including&#8230;</li>\n<li><strong>New Import System</strong> - The new import system leverages the abstraction done at the data layer, so that import routines can call simple functions to convert posts from other blogging tools instead of a huge complicated series of queries.  Importers are also available directly from the admin, so no special process need be taken to employ them.  (Thanks, <a href=\"http://lair.fierydragon.org\">tinster</a>.)</li>\n<li><strong>Admin Redesign</strong> - It&#8217;s not so significant as the Tiger Admin plugin, but there are a few more gadgets in the admin, especially on the Write page.  You can now drag sections of the page to reorganize them, and click the plus/minus to expand/contract the sections.</li>\n<li><strong>The Rich Editor</strong> - WordPress has a new post editor built in that lets you see what you&#8217;re going to get without having to decipher tags.  You can also resize the editing area on the fly by dragging it, which is pretty cool.  Not everyone who has tried it likes the WYSIWYG editor, so there is an option to disable it on a per-user basis.</li>\n<li><strong>Image/File Uploading</strong> - Just under the Rich Editor in the Write panel, there is a new control that allows you to upload and insert images into your posts.  WordPress keeps track of these images and can even automatically provide dedicated pages to receive comments for them.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Post Preview</strong> - Instead of displaying the post as plain text below the editor, the post is now displayed in an embedded frame, using all of the layout and CSS that is normally applied to your site.  In effect, the post looks <em>exactly</em> like it will when you publish it, giving you ample opportunity to review the post&#8217;s layout.</li>\n<li><strong>User Metadata</strong> - To support user-based options, the user data now sports a much more flexible structure.  People who use WordPress as a CMS can now use code to add custom data of any kind to any user profile.</li>\n<li><strong>User Roles and Capabilities</strong> - The &#8220;user level&#8221; concept of security has now been replaced with Roles.  WordPress associates a Role to each user. Roles have Capabilities such as &#8220;edit posts&#8221; and &#8220;activate plugins&#8221; that allow certain actions.  There is no more concept of hierarchical users, but plugin authors can now create whole new Capabilities to apply proper permission management.</li>\n<li><strong>Presentation Page Changes</strong> - WordPress 1.5 lets you switch themes, and 2.0 shows you what they look like before you do it.  If a theme includes a screenshot, you&#8217;ll see it in the Presentation admin panel to help you choose the theme for your site.</li>\n<li><strong>Ajax Category Addition</strong> - There&#8217;s a bunch of ajax in WordPress 2.0 and this is probably the most requested use of it.  This feature lets you add new categories directly from the post-writing page.</li>\n<li><strong>Ajax List Management</strong> - There are a few places in the admin that show lists of things and let you delete, like categories, posts, comments.  Now, instead of reloading, the row turns red and then fades out.</li>\n<li><strong>Moved Javascript/Images</strong> - Version 2.0 uses a lot more javascript than prior versions.  Some utilities, like <a href=\"http://www.axentric.com/posts/default/7\">FAT</a> (Fade Anything Technique) and <a href=\"http://twilightuniverse.com/2005/05/sack-of-ajax/\">SACK</a> (Simple Ajax Code Kit), can be used by other tools and plugins, so it&#8217;s good to put them someplace where developers know they will reside, and outside of the admin directory, which might have weird permissions.</li>\n<li><strong>Theme Admin Pages</strong> - The guys who worked on <a href=\"http://binarybonsai.com/wordpress/k2/\">K2</a> went to some lengths to hack a custom configuration page for their theme into the WordPress admin.  Now that capability is easily available by including a functions.php file with the theme.  You can see this at work in the new header generator for the Default theme.</li>\n<li><strong>Ping Delay Removed</strong> - Rather than pinging trackbacks and pingbacks when the post is saved (this causes the delay you see when posting to WP1.5), the pings are attempted via a different method that allows the admin interface to respond more quickly.</li>\n<li><strong>Persistent Cache</strong> - There are certain types of queries that WordPress makes to the database repeatedly.  To speed things up, the results of these queries are cached to disk.  This caching is still compatible with other caching plugins, like WP-Cache, and could be just enough of a boost for larger sites to avoid optimizing everything.</li>\n<li><strong>Database Versioning</strong> - Now when updates are made to the database schema, your admin panel will tell you to run the upgrade routines.  This is handy because it keeps your database fresh enough to support the code that runs on it.</li>\n<li><strong>New Built-In Plugins</strong> - WordPress 2.0 is now packed with the Akismet plugin for comment spam prevention, and the WP-DB-Backup plugin for manual or automated database backups.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those are the major features added since 1.5.2 was released on August 20th.  In addition to these major items (did I forget anything, anyone?) a few hundred bug fixes have been applied.  I did not count them to know the specific number, but there were a lot.  If you have a favorite bug that you wanted squashed, you should head over to <a href=\"http://trac.wordpress.org\">the bug database</a> and search for it.

An IP like <code>221.3.235.96</code> will be flagged as a spam indicator far sooner than the words \"Industrious\" and \"Soldier\".\n</p>\n<p>\nSo once again I say, <a href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2005/09/16/dear-spammers\">thank you, spammers</a>.

This is my official propaganda that describes the philosophy behind Stone Code Productions.  For those of you who are unimpressed by marketing schemes, be not afraid.  Stone Code will also feature a technical dossier which will explain our skills, the types of jobs we\'ll handle, and more nuts and bolts information about the company.  However, we need to figure out what those nuts and bolts are going to be before we delineate them!  Nevertheless, here is the whimsical and wonderful Statement of Purpose from the little code house that could.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhat is Stone Code?\r\n\r\nFrom ancient times to the present, Stone has represented the\r\neverlasting.  Countless companies have tried to solidify their\r\nfortitude through some reference or another to rocks of some variety.\r\nHowever, there is a deeper meaning than that of raw and uncut\r\nstrength.  Some of the most well known structures in the world have\r\nbeen carved from the very foundation that makes up our earth.  When we\r\nthink of stone, we think of the wonders of the parthenon, the mystical\r\nappeal of legendary stone henge, the central figures of the Zen\r\ngardens of Japan, and the very hearth of the land we stand on.\r\nStrength to carry on throughout the ages, with a certain beauty that\r\ncan only be forged by true artisans, we feel that this concept is a\r\nperfect metaphor for our design goals.\r\n\r\nOf course, Stone is only half of the phrase we have coined for\r\nourselves.  The word \'code\' can be quite ambiguous, and it is our goal\r\nas professionals to guide you through the complexity of the world of\r\nprogramming with clarity and satisfaction.  The artisans of Stone Code\r\nProductions have acquired a true relationship with the code they have\r\nproduced, and are capable of understanding and improving the code of\r\nothers when the need arises.  We invite you to share with us your\r\nvision, so that we may provide durable and beautiful solutions for\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nWhen our conception of Stone and Code merge together, we acquire Stone\r\nCode.   The work produced is inherently beautiful because our design\r\nphilosophy centers on form equally as it does on functionality.\r\nBecause our developers place so much pride in their work, it seems\r\nonly natural that it should be free.  Do not be alarmed that we will\r\nnot provide work designed for commercial gain, because that is\r\ncertainly not the case.

Unfortunately, some of the effects of the rush I was in could be seen in the quality of the release materials, not necessarily the code, but the announcement on ruby-talk and some of the documents such as the README.  I did write a nice <a href=\"http://ruport.rubyforge.org/ruport_manual.pdf\">manual</a> that anyone who is remotely interested in the Ruby Reports system should check out.  The code itself is like a newborn baby... it\'s a bundle of hope and possibly joy for some, but it already has poop filled diapers that need changing and is a little irritable because it\'s teething.  Nevertheless, there should be some good things out on the horizon regarding Ruport, so keep your eyes peeled.\r\n\r\nJames and I plan to keep our promise regarding releasing Gambit before the fall.  He thinks the last day of summer is the Autumn Equinox (September 21) whereas I thought that we were implying we\'d have it out before Labor Day (September 5).  Therefore, my part of Gambit will be done by the 5th, and his by latest the 21st.  The release of Gambit should be very exciting, and if anyone wants to see a summary of our codefest this summer, there is a great <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.ruby/browse_frm/thread/a5bffa04578395e0/8e59ea3a0a984442?lnk=st&q=Gambit+postmortem&rnum=1#8e59ea3a0a984442\">\r\narticle</a> on ruby-talk which James wrote.

It talked about the nature of anarchism and itâ€™s influence on society. (Thatâ€™s small a anarchism, not necessarily the brand associated with the Anarchist Movement, but just the nature of unestablished action ) It talks about the oligarchyâ€™s tendency to try to limit the openness of society in support of authority and state, and even their various attempts to create the illusion of â€˜panicsâ€™ which make such circumventions of freedom seem just or reasonable. Siva provides a pragmatic analysis of the situation, and is not afraid to admit weaknesses or problems existent within the various Anti-Establishment movements (to include that of the Libertarians) and though I may not share his moderate view, I respect this in his presentation. He is clearly in favor of an open society but is willing to consider the claims and concerns of the other side, which makes it more likely for people to take him seriously. This book was very high level, and though it does not limit itself to a particular niche, you may find yourself struggling in places if you are not a technophile or a fan of the sciences. Nevertheless, it was an amazing read despite the fact that it ate up my whole day. \"\r\n\r\nSiva responded on my personal blog which was surprising.

With the help of James Edward Gray II, hopefully we\'ll put together a great program for the students here.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://stonecode.org/organizations/unh.rb\">http://stonecode.org/organizations/unh.rb/</a>','UNH.rb',0,'','publish','open','open','','unhrb','','','2005-10-26 02:53:31','2005-10-26 06:53:31','',0,'http://www.stonecode.org/blog/?p=11',0),(12,2,'2005-09-20 15:58:29','2005-09-20 19:58:29','So, it appears that I\'ve taken it upon myself to fight for yet another community\'s rights.\r\n\r\nThis time, it was the University of New Haven student body.  Our network was out for over 2 hours consistantly and many more smaller increments throughout the weekend, causing me to miss both of my scheduled UNH.rb online meetings as well as experience all sorts of problems that someone as reliant on the Internet as I am.  \r\n\r\nFirst I will offer my account of the situation in plain terms so those of you who scratched your head at the Network Status message can get an idea of what happened in plain terms.\r\n\r\n<em>A critical network component failed, causing the entire network to experience an outage.  There was a backup system in place, but it did not switch over correctly due to a malfunction.  The department identified the problem with this piece of hardware earlier, and the replacement is on the way, but it failed before they could replace it.  Though it normally would not take a long time to replace this device in an emergency, there were some scheduling conflicts that delayed the process. \r\n</em>\r\n\r\nNow if you\'re interested in the whole story, read on.\r\n\r\nInstinctively I sent a somewhat hostile message to the Director of Networking as well as the student body.  The reason for this was a combination of frustration and the fact that the explanation the student body recieved was insufficient and unclear as to what the actual problem was.  I highly doubt anyone understood a word in it, because it was in a jargon only network nerds (such as myself) can or should comprehend.  Therefore, I needed to elicit a response which would clarify what actually happened.\r\n\r\nImmediately after it was sent, I recieved over 10 emails and instant messages thanking me for putting in words the frustrations of the student body.\r\n\r\nAlan MacDougall was the  first to address my concerns.  We had a rather extensive dialogue in which I learned what the actual situation was, the actions of the department throughout the situation, as well as the stance taken by the department about future issues.  Unfortunately, Alan declined permission for me to show you what he said, which may have been an appropriate action if he intended to protect the reputation of his department, or not have it cast in a skewed light.\r\n\r\nHowever, here is essentially the jist of what was said.  The issue was primarily one in getting a technician or administrator to the University in a timely fashion to resolve the problem.  There was trouble contacting Greg, the Director of Networking, and this led to the disorganization which increased the delay in fixing the problem.\r\n\r\nThis problem was never supposed to happen in the first place, because the system was SUPPOSED to go to a backup one if it failed.  This may be part of the reason why it was not watched as closely as it should have been, though Alan did not comment on this.\r\n\r\nAlan cited that 87 hours of downtime was not unheard of or uncommon in businesses.  This is 99% reliability, which may seem like a big number, but in real terms, clearly is not.\r\n\r\nFor this, I refer you to Technet:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\"In an organization that is operational 24x7x365 (24 hours a day/seven days a week/365 days a year), systems that are 99 percent reliable will be unavailable, on average, 87 hours (3.5 days) every year. Moreover, that downtime can occur at unpredictable timesâ€”possibly when it is least affordable. It is important to understand that an availability level of 99 percent could prove costly to your business.\r\n\r\nInstead, the percentage of uptime you should strive for is some variation of 99.x percentâ€”with an ultimate goal of five nines, or 99.999 percent. For a single server in your organization, three nines (99.9 percent) is an achievable level of availability. Achieving five nines (99.999 percent) is unrealistic for a single server because this level of availability allows for approximately five minutes of downtime per calendar year. However, by implementing fault tolerant clusters with automatic failover capabilities, four nines (99.99 percent) is achievable. It is even possible to achieve five nines if you also implement fault tolerant measures, such as server-class hardware, advanced storage solutions, and service redundancy.\"\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/exchange/guides/E2k3HighAvGuide/268d7cbe-fbe5-4287-babc-143487c3969b.mspx\">Original link</a>\r\n\r\nSo if Alan\'s indication is that we can expect 99% reliability, that mean you might expect about 1.5 hours of downtime a week.\r\n\r\nHowever, before I make it seem that the Tech department is evil and out to screw University Students, let me clarify:\r\n\r\nIt\'s not that they aren\'t doing their job, it\'s not that they don\'t care.  From talking to both of these individuals, it\'s obvious that our needs are important to them.  However, you may not (and probably have not) realized that from the \"Network Status\" which tend to be terse and overly complex at best.   \r\n\r\nMr. Bartholomow also declined permission for me to quote him directly, but indicated that the messages sent to the students are less informative than they can be, because it is enormously difficult to find the appropriate wording for such things.   This certainly has some truth to it. \r\n\r\nMr. Bartholomew asserted that there was indeed a scheduling conflict involved and that it would be dealt with in due course.\r\nHe also informed me that the new hardware will be redundant so that we will not have this same problem again.\r\n\r\nHe indicated that if it were possible with the current funding to have a 24/7 staff, they would have one.  However, again it boils down to \'not enough money to go around\' which forces our University\'s departments to make due with what they have.\r\n\r\nI am uneasy with this, and really hope that the University takes this seriously and gets the Technology department (or whatever their official name is) the money they need to achieve 99.99% uptime, which is the goal we should be striving for. \r\n\r\nOur technology department is full of capable and hard working people.  It may just be that these people do not place enough emphasis on making it clear to the students that they care.   The best way for them to do so is give simple, honest, complete explanations to the student body and the university as a whole.  Most of you don\'t know what a \'blade\' is, but everyone can understand that they were having trouble contact the right people to fix the problem, that there was supposed to be a backup system that failed, and that they\'re working on prevention methods to keep this from happening again.  But you wouldn\'t know that from the email they sent you, and therein lies the problem.\r\n\r\nIt is our responsibility as students to ask the hard questions when necessary, to demand clear and truthful explanations of problems.  Sometimes, even we forget that.  So it\'s not surprising that maybe the tech department got a little laxed with their communications regarding a very serious problem.\r\n\r\nIt is my hope that they use this as a learning experience, and that the student body will be more vigilant about their rights and continue to demand that our departments respect them.  It is their duty to serve our needs, and though they may be doing a great job of it working on this behind the scenes, they haven\'t made it clear to us, and they certainly should.\r\n\r\nIt is also my hope that the University opens up a dialogue with the tech department that involves a REAL evaluation of costs involved in providing a reliable network.  It seems like we\'re trying to squeeze blood from a stone, and from my experience, it ends up costing more and being less effective in the long run to use an incomplete solution as a means to an end.\r\n\r\nBottom line... Students need to speak up when they think something is fishy, The tech department needs to address the real problem in plain terms whenever it shows up so that the University community understands, and the University itself needs to open the pocketbook a little wider so that we can be ensured reliable connectivity to the Internet, as it is absolutely essential and holds a higher priority in most of our lives than many other \"improvements\" that can be made to the campus.\r\n\r\nBut this is just a rant from an angry coder who lost the internet for a couple hours.  Don\'t take me too seriously.\r\n\r\nI hope this offers an alternate view of the situation for anyone interested though.\r\n\r\nI appreciate Alan and Greg\'s efforts to clarify the situation with me, and I hope that I have explained it in a way you\'ll be able to understand too.  Of course, this is only my account, so do not take it as absolute or fully correct.\r\n\r\nThat\'s the end of this chapter... Hopefully we\'ve all learned something that will improve our community for the better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','The University of New Haven Network Outage',0,'','publish','open','open','','the-university-of-new-haven-network-outage','','','2005-10-02 12:40:00','2005-10-02 16:40:00','',0,'http://www.stonecode.org/blog/?p=12',0),(13,2,'2005-09-28 03:14:20','2005-09-28 07:14:20','It\'s safe to say that Ruport is starting to get \'Down with the Sickness\'.\r\n\r\nScheduled release date for Ruport 0.2.0 is Friday, October 7th.

He explained a bit about MockFS, including the crackrock feature that redefines Fileutils and the like.  I personally think that\'s cool as hell but it does seem like it could be incredibly dangerous.\r\n\r\nHe mentioned the fact that <a href=\"http://lafcadio.rubyforge.org\">Lafcadio</a> completly mocks MySQL to the point where you can test it without even having a database installed.

In fact, it seemed as if this was the central point of the talk, rather than open-uri itself.  This is not due to the fact that open-uri is not worth much attention, but rather that it is designed so simply, that everything it does just \'makes sense\'.  Through his talk, Akira showed us how to follow the DRY methodology and the \"no configuration is good configuration\" concept to produce something simple yet elegant.\r\n\r\nThe JRuby talk was a bit over my head as I\'ve closed my eyes to Java and never want to look back.  There was some quite interesting discussion of the limitations of an implementation within the JVM (such as stack depth and speed), but nevertheless, for those who need to sneak Ruby through the system, I\'m sure this talk helped them get up to speed, as well as point out any gotchas that might be of note.  I think it\'s pretty neat that they\'re going to continue to try to make mainstream ruby apps run under JRuby. \r\n\r\nWell... the YARV talk is downright hilarious.  So I\'m going to put my attention into it right now.  More on that (and a top secret Ruport discussion / hackfest? ) in a bit.\r\n\r\n','Open-URI / JRuby',0,'','publish','open','open','','open-uri-jruby','','','2005-10-14 17:44:42','2005-10-14 21:44:42','',0,'http://www.stonecode.org/blog/?p=22',0),(23,2,'2005-10-14 18:38:58','2005-10-14 22:38:58','The YARV talk was excellent.  Koichi Sasada is one of the most entertaining people I\'ve seen at this conference.  It seems as if YARV is getting really close to being \'ready\'.  Of course, he\'s got plenty of hurdles to cross before it\'s 100% there.  The best way I can summarize the talk is that YARV is way faster than the current interpreter and that it pulls some really neat tricks as far as the way it handles ruby code.  Of course, it\'s going to need to handle c extensions, which means it\'ll need to be able to run mkmf.rb or implement some equivalent, which is cannot yet do.\r\n\r\nTwo very cool things to be taken out of this talk:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. ) <a href=\"http://www.atdot.net/yc/\">http://www.atdot.net/yc/</a> : \r\n\r\nA CGI based program that\'ll compile your ruby and then decompile it into YARV bytecode.  (Which will let you see how Sasada is doing a good job of making assembly language look as non scary as it can be)\r\n\r\n2.)   His demonstration showed that regular YARV is twice as fast as the ruby C interpreter, and the complicated but optimized YARV runs 4 times as fast.\r\n\r\nA 400% speed increase will put Ruby ahead of Python and Perl... giving us Rubyists even more bragging rights :)\r\n\r\nHere comes Reimplementing Ruby in Ruby.

Let\'s get Ruby the hell out of C so that it can be understood better!  Makes sense to me, I have never looked at the source code for the interpreter but I imagine there is some voodoo in there that would look far nicer in Ruby.\r\n\r\nIt seems like this project has two major caveats.  1) It hinges on a lot of other dependencies... understandably.  2) It\'s a HUGE project.\r\n\r\nHopefully Seattle.rb will be able to pull together the resources necessary to do this, because it\'s really cool.  The talk was interesting because it let us get an insight into what exactly is going on underneath the hood in Ruby and how it might look with a bit of a facelift via a language change.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me like implementing the system in itself will be enormously complex, but I guess that\'s what makes it so damn interesting.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who are interested, after the roundtable discussion tonight I\'m going to be hacking on <a href=\"http://ruport.rubyforge.org\">Ruport</a>.\r\n\r\n I\'d love to meet up with some of you that are interested in this project to get suggestions and pretty much steal your ideas.

I simply needed to see the Pacific Ocean and it ended up costing me almost $40 and about 5 hours of time, but I got there :)\r\n\r\nWhen I came back, I got into the room to see Matz sitting there answering a barrage of questions.  It seemed as if that was a scary position to be in, but that he was enjoying it.  Someone asked if there was anything from Perl 6 that he\'d consider stealing, and to get a rouse out of the room, Matz just said one word \"Arrow\".\r\n\r\nIt was funny to hear Austin Zielger asked \"when we can expect Marshalling for all objects\" as if he was saying \"When am I going to get my money\" while holding a tire iron.  Matz laid it out straight, we\'ll never see it.  There is just no clear way to deal with marshalling certain things.  However, the biggest concerns were things such as procs and closures and singletons, which Matz said would be addressed in 2.0\r\n\r\nThen the question of the evening (IMHO) was posed by Hal Fulton.  He asked if Matz though Ruby 2.0 is too ambitious to be attainable.  Matz said something to the effect that 2.0 might be something like Perl 6, which caused a silence to fall over the room.   But Matz reassured us that we\'d all keep working hard and we\'d get there \"eventually\".\r\n\r\nAll in all, it was an exciting evening.\r\n\r\nThe No Clergy talk was pretty interesting.  Kevin Baird demonstrated how his software worked, and I thought the idea was great.  A democratic orchestra?  For those of you who aren\'t familiar with No Clergy, it\'s basically this polling system that takes a bunch of traits and allows the audience to rate them and then does some Markovian transformations on the music to generate sheets that reflect the popular opinion.  This is done actively throughout the performance.\r\n\r\nThe relevance to ruby was the fact that this software was originally written in Python and was refactored into Ruby.   He explained the system a bit, and it certainly shows promise.\r\n\r\nI found his webpage for the software, but it\'s quite limited in information.   Nevertheless:\r\n<a href=\"http://nibbler.med.buffalo.edu/noclergy/?li=yes\">http://nibbler.med.buffalo.edu/noclergy/?li=yes</a>\r\n\r\nSome interesting points to note are that Kevin threw the question regarding packaging (Gems vs. Debian) at the audience.  Thankfully, someone suggested \"why not both!?!\", Kevin admitted laziness, which of course elicited the response \"script it away!\"... I\'m sure that a rake task could handle this quite quickly. \r\n\r\nSomeone also mentioned that there is an automated gem -> ebuild program for gentoo.  A quick googling couldn\'t locate this, but as a regular Gentoo user myself, I\'m definitly going to have to find it.\r\n\r\nThere was a talk about a Refactoring browser for Ruby.  Meh.  I feel like vim takes fine care of me.   Though I think such tools would be great for people who enjoy FreeRide and the like.\r\n\r\nOkay, so thats that.  Marine Bio talk is going on right now.   He is finally getting into the Ruby, there was quite a bit of background information which I admittedly did not catch all of.  But I\'ll be sure to comment on the ruby in a bit.\r\n\r\nExtracurricular Activities:\r\n\r\n1) Ruport\r\n\r\nI did not end up doing much work on Ruport because I felt like I was going to die after the walk in and around Coronado but today and tonight will certainly give rise to some Ruport news.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain feature everyone wants that I was saying no to for a while but have caved.  You bastards are getting charting support!\r\n\r\n2) Go.  \r\n\r\nI found a guy playing Go on his machine.

It was interesting to see that it is possible to use Ruby in a real time environment and he accomplishes this through some tricky communication with embedded controllers that use  C firmware which is configured by Ruby.\r\n\r\nHe made an interesting point about some issues with Mutex, such as the ability for a thread to come along and pretty much highjack the lock, or something to that effect.  This was a bit over my head, honestly.\r\n\r\nOne of the coolest things was that he explained how he managed to get the ruby interpreter to be incredibly small (< 2 MB total ) by going through the makefile and dropping things such as tk, curses, and the like from the standard lib.\r\n\r\nThis sounds like a lot of fun, and of course, in his case, a necessary condition for certain applications.\r\n\r\nThe PDF::Writer presentation was yet another mind blowing experience.  Austin Ziegler started by generating his slideshow using PDF::Writer.   It was using an upcoming presentation system, which has not yet been implemented in a major release.\r\n\r\nHe showed all sorts of neat little tricks with PDF::Writer including SVG support.  He also managed to show us some of the areas of PDF::Writer that still need work.\r\n\r\nOver lunch myself and some others talked to him about charting and he let us know that someone offered some contributions.   With the demand for charts in Ruport, if these contributions come later rather than sooner, it\'s likely I will contribute some charting functionality as well, though it might be a little bit coupled to Ruport.\r\n\r\nAustin talked fairly extensively about good API design and suggested that it\'s a matter of feeling out a piece of software until it feels right and then being consistent.  Between PDF::Writer and open-uri, I am getting more and more inspired to provide a beautiful API for Ruport, though this probably means a fairly heavy amount of refactoring.\r\n\r\nFor those who are curious, Ruport is finally passing it\'s shoddy unit tests again after a HORRIBLE mishap (details later).  These tests are going to be completely rewritten using some of the ideas and methodologies I\'ve picked up out here.\r\n\r\nJim Weirich has the floor now for DSLs.

They went through the whole suite of oddities from Ruby2C to Ruby2Ruby and warned us of the amazing amount of Dragons that lie beneath.  There were two projects that tied into this that appeared to be very useful though, these two are <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/rubyinline/\">RubyInline</a> and <a href=\"http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenTest/\">ZenTest</a>\r\n\r\nRubyInline basically makes C appear to be interpreted by letting you literally drop it in place alongside Ruby code.  It handles all the compiling and linking for you internally, leaving no hassle for you.\r\n\r\nZenTest generates missing methods from tests, and missing tests from methods.  The coolest thing in the package is unit-diff, which prevents the whole \r\n\r\n[100linesofgoodhtml] expected but got [100linesofbadhtml].\r\n\r\nIt produces diff files showing exactly what was different between the two :)\r\n\r\nFor the DSL presentation, Jim Weirich brought us through the dredges of ruby\'s voodoo in such things as Constant / Method missing to implement simple to write and clean domain specific languages.\r\n\r\nHe implemented this killer Rubik\'s cube application which ran in IRb and implemented a DSL that interpreted Rubik notation and even offered a nice colored display.  A quick google implies it\'s not just sitting out there online for our consumption, but if you can find it, check it out because it was downright awesome. \r\n\r\nAnyway, Karlin is now talking about Systir, which I will have more on later.','Zenhacks /  DSLs',0,'','publish','open','open','','zenhacks-dsls','','','2005-10-15 18:46:51','2005-10-15 22:46:51','',0,'http://www.stonecode.org/blog/?p=27',0),(28,2,'2005-10-18 02:06:21','2005-10-18 06:06:21','The conference was amazing.  Everyone who participated was so great to be around.  I even managed to rustle up some Ruport supporters :)\r\n\r\nThe keynote address, though it bordered on a flamewar, showed some great ideas from Dave Thomas regarding the lambda dillema...\r\nsuggesting <em>def (n = 5) ... end</em>, which to me seems great (No arrows!)  Of course, david black\'s suggestion of lambda (x =2) ... end was also quite compelling.  An interesting compromise was proposed that the latter be a closure and the former not, which is quite interesting.\r\n\r\nMatz\'s theme was \"wild and crazy\' ideas, and I\'m sure you can find a summary elsewhere regarding the specifics.  One great thing from the conference were the people using SubEthaEdit to do some collaborative journalism.  These posts are on the feed, so I\'m sure you\'ve probably seen them already.\r\n\r\nThe final panels on rails and the long tail and damagecontrol were interesting, but in my not at all humble opinion, paled in comparison to the earlier talks.   DamageControl looked promising but there were a lot of technical difficulties and pinholes that got in the way of an otherwise good presentation. However, DHH\'s workshop on \"What\'s new in Rails 1.0\" made up for this, and pretty much got us up to speed on what to expect.  I\'m excited about schema support and the ability to freeze the gems, as these two features seem really handy.\r\n\r\nFrom what I heard, the continuations talk was brain melting but awesome.\r\n\r\nI\'m proud to say that I\'m going to be doing my best to attend the monthly NYC.rb meetings from now on.

And to my surprise, i walked into the place to see David Black just sitting there.\r\n\r\nIt was amazing to see someone from RubyCentral attending a meeting at a group I thought would never get off the ground.\r\n\r\nI guess I was mistaken.  13 strong, this group of ruby newbies and intermediates alike came together with some incredible chemistry.\r\n\r\nIt was amazing to see all these people getting together, talking about many great ideas, sharing some of the problems they\'ve been having, etc.\r\n\r\nIt was also scary as hell to present a talk on unit tests to a group that I expected to be 3 or 4 strong, and newbies at that.\r\n\r\nThe main chunks of the meeting were my talk, Paul\'s talk on Solitaire Cypher, a code review of one member\'s Rails project, and an open discussion featuring a small argument regarding type safety and also whether or not \'walks like a duck\' is sufficient or if we need a more solid indicator for the users of libraries.  (I was on the \'you don\'t need it\' side of the fence  but Gary and others made some excellent points)\r\n\r\nThe entire Stone code team was there, Rob, Greg G., and myself.  David Black found a bug in one of Ruport\'s test cases that I thought i fixed before the release, but obviously didn\'t.  The good news is I switched the suspicious <code> assert()</code> call to the  intended <code>assert_equal()</code> and Ruport still passed.\r\n\r\nI am very unpleased with how DataSet#eql? is working (or not working) and I also don\'t like the test file ruport is generating when you call ruport_generate.   I\'d also like to automate SQL build scripts if possible.  It seems like a Ruport 0.2.1 is in order for this weekend, so get ready to run gem update for some minor cleanup by the end of this weekend.  \r\n\r\nI am totally psyched about new_haven.rb, the group is amazing.

You try something, you get some feedback, you change a few things, you get more feedback.  It\'s exactly the same as running a piece of code and it dumping an error like \"You\'ve got a foo where there should be a bar on line 12\".   Of course, life is more subtle than this, and we\'re often thrown the \"Syntax error on line 80000\" when you\'re dealing with a 20 line piece of code.   These type of pitfalls are where we simply need to use deduction to find the source of the problem, and not rely on the flawed feedback we\'re getting.   As agile developers, we understand this practice well when it comes to programming.   Sometimes, the feedback you get is not the right feedback you need to get the job done.   So it follows that we should practice this in our behaviors as well.  \r\n\r\nWhen I first started out programming, I was very good at building things exactly as a customer told me to.   But this is not Agile nor is it a good business practice.   My first few customers were quite displeased, no matter how close I came to meeting there expectations.  To me, this is like typing perfectly valid code that does the complete wrong job.  You say... \"there was no error when it started up\" and then when you click the big red button, your monitor shuts off instead of an email being sent or whatever it was supposed to do.  These are the more subtle errors that we need to check by inspection and use a bit of intuition to solve.  This is why understanding what the customer wants is more valuable than understanding what they say.  The more technically adept, the more dangerous a customer becomes.  My current employer is a skilled DBA.   He is not a skilled rubyist.   He\'s a smart guy so he\'s pretty good at explaining what he wants, but then when it comes down to how he thinks it should be done, it\'s really important to refactor his plans to make more sense for the real problem at hand.   I am finally learning (through trial by fire), that an open and insightful employer WILL let you make design decisions that differ from theirs as long as it makes sense within the problem domain.  So to me... the informal specifications are kind of like your logical unit tests, so it\'s important to be sure you\'re testing for the right conditions.   If you forget the edge cases, throw an assert where there should be an assert_equal, or just frame your tests so that they meet the wrong conditions, you\'re working against yourself.\r\n\r\nSo, my only point in this rant is that when you think about Agile Software Development, go ahead and read The Pragmatic Programmer and dig into the core of the Agile Manifesto and all of that stuff.  It\'s really a motivating experience and there is a ton of practical knowledge to be gained there.   But when it boils down to applying it, don\'t try terribly hard to fit some pattern, don\'t worry that Dave Thomas or Martin Fowler is going to pop out of the closet and say \"That\'s not agile!\".   Just sit down, and think about how you do your work.  What comes naturally when it\'s just you and the compiler / interpreter and a ream of source code.   Now think of applying that to your behaviors without alienating your customer.  Grab a piece of paper, draw some mock ups.   Write some unit tests during a meeting, forget the UML that they don\'t understand and you can\'t use.   Do a quick one up prototype, get some people around the monitor and let them say \"Foo is cool but I hate bar\".   \r\n\r\nAgile has become this insane buzzword and people are acting like it\'s this way of life.   Well, it is a way of life, but you already know about it well.   It\'s just a matter of applying it beyond your interaction with the keyboard and into the meeting room or the coffee shop, or wherever your business needs doing.\r\n\r\n','Agile works because it\'s what developers know best...',0,'','publish','open','open','','agile-development-works-because-its-what-developers-know-best','','','2005-11-12 13:45:53','2005-11-12 17:45:53','',0,'http://www.stonecode.org/blog/?p=38',0),(39,2,'2005-11-29 00:09:31','2005-11-29 04:09:31','Ruport 0.2.9 \'I didn\'t sleep for 2 days straight\' Edition is out:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.ruby/browse_thread/thread/baccd5b9c0c07687/e5222ed930dc81de#e5222ed930dc81de\">Original Announcement Here</a>\r\n\r\nI would write more but I am seriously tired...\r\n','Ruport 0.2.9',0,'','publish','open','open','','ruport-029','','','2005-11-29 00:09:31','2005-11-29 04:09:31','',0,'http://www.stonecode.org/blog/?p=39',0),(40,2,'2005-12-03 04:50:50','2005-12-03 08:50:50','One of the highest search references this site has been hit with this month have to do with Ruport Rails integration...\r\n\r\nWell...  will Ruport ever directly support Rails?
